# Supermart-Grocery-Sales---Retail-Analytics-Dataset
This project uses a fictional dataset of grocery sales from a supermart to predict sales based on features like category, sub-category, city, region, discount, and profit. The goal is to explore the data, preprocess it, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance to predict future sales accurately.
