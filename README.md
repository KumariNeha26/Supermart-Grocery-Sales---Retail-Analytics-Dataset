Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset

Project Overview
This project explores grocery sales data from a supermarket to predict future sales trends. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling to identify key sales drivers and improve forecasting accuracy.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and encode categorical features.
EDA: Visualize trends, analyze sales distribution, and examine correlations.
Feature Selection & Model Building: Select relevant features, scale data, and split it for training.
Model Training: Implement Linear Regression to predict sales.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using MSE and R-squared metrics.
Visualization & Insights: Compare actual vs. predicted sales and summarize key findings.

This project provides data-driven insights to enhance retail sales strategies and improve demand forecasting.
