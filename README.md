# Supermart-Grocery-Sales---Retail-Analytics-Dataset
This project uses a fictional dataset of grocery sales from a supermart to predict sales based on features like category, sub-category, city, region, discount, and profit. The goal is to explore the data, preprocess it, build a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance to predict future sales accurately.

Project Steps
Import Libraries: Load libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.
Load Dataset: Read and display the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and encode categorical data.
EDA: Visualize trends, sales distribution, and correlations.
Feature Selection & Model Building: Choose features, scale data, and split the dataset.
Train Model: Use Linear Regression to predict sales.
Model Evaluation: Assess performance using MSE and R-squared.
Visualize Results: Plot actual vs predicted sales.
Conclusion: Summarize findings and suggest next steps.
