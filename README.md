Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics

This project analyzes grocery sales data from a supermarket to predict sales trends based on category, region, discount, and profit margins. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, machine learning model training, and evaluation.

Project Steps
Data Import & Preprocessing:
  Load and clean the dataset.
  Handle missing values, duplicates, and encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Visualize sales trends, regional distribution, and discounts.
  Identify correlations between sales and key factors.

Feature Engineering & Model Building:
  Select relevant features for sales prediction.
  Train a Linear Regression model to forecast future sales.

Model Evaluation:
  Assess model accuracy using MSE (Mean Squared Error) and R-squared scores.

Results Visualization & Conclusion:
  Compare actual vs predicted sales through charts and graphs.
  Provide insights to optimize pricing, discounts, and inventory management.
